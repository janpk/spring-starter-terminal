# Spring Starter Terminal
Simple script that uses dialog as a terminal UI for creating new Spring application using the Spring Starter / Spring Initializer service. A little quick and dirty, and the UI has major room for improvement relating to sizes. Most of the choices are also not "persistent" between selecting, going back to main menu and going back to selection again. You can create a project, and it will unpack in the folder you are running the script from (useful to have in PATH if you dare ;) ).
